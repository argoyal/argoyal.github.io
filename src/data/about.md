# Intro

I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Spotmentor](https://www.ey.com/en_in/consulting/spotmentor-digital-learning-solutions), now part of EY. Spotmentor is an end to end skilling, learning and careers platform solving a very specific problem in the HR Technology space. At Spotmentor, I was able to setup digital academies for some very large clients. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At EY Spotmentor, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build state of the art infrastructure systems using Kubernetes and AWS. I also have handson experience in generating on-line predictive models with technologies like , [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily worked as a systems engineer and platform stack engineer but have broad experience across Spotmentorâ€™s stack.
