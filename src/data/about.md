# Intro

I am a seasoned technology leader with a proven track record of successfully leading teams of 60+ professionals and delivering high-quality, impactful projects. As an ex-entrepreneur, I thrive in product-driven environments and have navigated the full lifecycle of building, scaling, and exiting a startup. With deep expertise in DevOps, cloud environments, and the Python stack, I take a holistic approach to technology. My strong grasp of systems architecture enables me to design and implement scalable, efficient solutions that align with business objectives. 'Analyzing real-world problems, curating solutions, and implementing them through the digital platform is my passion'-this philosophy drives me in every endeavor. Whether it's architecting robust infrastructure, optimizing cloud operations, or mentoring teams to deliver excellence, I am committed to leveraging technology for meaningful impact.

# Currently

At Calance, I am setting up a Digital and Emerging Technology practice, specialising in DevOps defined approach for Software delivery. I have been a key asset in bridging the gaps that existed between US Sales and Development center based out of India. I have developed exceptional relationships with some of the key people resembling Fortune 500 brands. I have been extensively involved in enabling AWS partnership for Calance, predominantly around Generative AI. I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build state of the art infrastructure systems using Kubernetes and AWS.
